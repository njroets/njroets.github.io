 1.	INTRODUCTION

<br>
Universities as a form of organisation are unique amongst the various types of organisations in society. They have endured for centuries (Kerr, 2001:220), they play an important role in nation states and societies (Kerr, 2001:209), and their function and size have increased over time (Kerr, 2001:200), while their output is difficult to assess and measure (Lockwood, 2011:127). 
Organisations are governed on behalf of principals and stakeholders. Governance is required to ensure an organisation achieves its intended goals, achieves the performance expected by principals and stakeholders, and survives change and adversity. Universities face numerous challenges and are exposed to forces of change. Therefore, universities or institutions of higher education require particular governance arrangements suited to the nature and context of each type of higher education institution (Fourie, 2009:351). 
Since the establishment of the first modern universities in Bologna and Paris, and extending to current times, Christianity has been linked to the establishment and identity of higher education institutions (Glanzer, Alleman & Ream, 2017:28). Universities have a history of being under church, emperor, or state control or influence, and more recently under private control. Today, Christian higher education remains a worldwide phenomenon.
Notwithstanding the long history of the university as organisation or the existence of codes of governance, governance failures are still a feature of the higher education environment. Good governance practice not only prevents governance and management failures but, viewed positively, contributes to effectiveness and performance of higher education institutions. Murdoch’s (2018) investigation of governance in private higher education institutions in South Africa points to a lack of understanding and implementation of good governance. Christian higher education institutions, as a subset of private higher education institutions, and as non-profit entities, are potentially impacted by the same governance shortcomings. No research has investigated the state of governance or considered guidelines for Christian higher education in South Africa. 
This study aims to provide guidelines to address the particular needs for governance in Christian higher education institutions in South Africa. 
<br>
2.	BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY
Recent history has seen growth in the establishment of Christian higher education institutions, particularly in Africa and Asia. The International Network of Christian Higher Education (INCHE) represents the interests of more than 40 institutions of Christian higher education globally on six continents (INCHE, 2021a).  INCHE was formed in 1975 during an international seminar in South Africa (INCHE, 2021b). Today, only one South African higher education organisation with membership of INCHE remains (INCHE, 2021c).
This study specifically considers university level higher education when referring to higher education. In regulatory terms this refer to those entities who has programs accredited on the Higher Education Qualifications Sub-Framework (HEQSF) and whose names and accredited programs appear on the Register of Private higher education institutions issues from time to time by the Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET).
In South Africa, Diedericks and Diedericks (2019:4) identify 24 amongst a total of 131 registered private higher education institutions with some identification with “Christian” perspectives. There are 25 public universities in South Africa (Department of Higher Education and Training, 2021a), none of which could be defined as having a Christian perspective (Diedericks & Diedericks, 2019:3).
Diedericks and Diedericks (2019:2) regards those higher education institutions with a “Christian identity (Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, or Protestant) and purpose in their vision and mission” as a Christian higher education institution. In a similar way this study regards those institutions who self-identify with a Christian identity as a Christian higher education institution. This self-identification should be located in the entities vision, mission or on other public documentation setting out the institutions purpose and identity, for example statements of faith on the institution’s website. It may take the form of a simple identification as having a Christian ethos or may be in the form of an extended statement of faith. 
Christian higher education as a particular type of institution within higher education has been slow to grow and expand in South-Africa compared to general private higher education in South Africa, as well as in comparison to the Christian higher education institutions in the rest of Africa and large parts of the world, including Asia and South America. The responsibility for the growth, survival and performance of these organisations, to a large degree lies with their governing bodies, who need to manage and steer them through challenges facing higher education. 
The challenges faced by all institutions of higher education in South Africa are shared by Christian higher education institutions. This includes a highly regulated industry and exposure to local and global forces of change in higher education, while competing with the courses offered by public universities and private for-profit institutions. Diedericks and Diedericks (2019:4) point out that the 24 organisations with some Christian reference are all non-profit organisations. They highlight specific challenges which non-profit companies face, and which Christian higher education institutions would arguably face as well. The failure of non-profit private higher education institutions is distinctly illustrated by the fact that almost two-thirds, or 62%, of all deregistered private higher education institutions were non-profit companies. Questions therefore arise about the lack of oversight capacity in this regard. 
The terms governance and management are sometimes used interchangeably in literature. Although certain activities and concepts may be linked or overlap, depending on how governance and management are prescribed and applied in each country, industry and organisation it needs to be pointed out that governance and management are distinct concepts. The distinction becomes clear when considering the unique nature of governance. King (2006) defines governance as the process through which decisions are made, specifically those decisions concerning the direction and strategy of an organisation. Furthermore, he highlights that companies form a strong connection between various stakeholders in society, where the interest of all stakeholders should be considered and respected, while the board of directors needs to act in the best interest of the company. Such a particular focus on strategy and stakeholder interests, coupled with each organisation’s unique context, creates the need for a framework in which governance can be applied. This need for a framework forms the background for the development of various codes of governance across the world. King (2006) summarises the phenomenon of governance with a metaphor, in which the directors of a company become the heart, mind and soul of an incapacitated company, in effect giving life to a lifeless juristic person. In contrast, management is primarily concerned with executing the strategy of a company, which in many cases revolves around maximising profits by employing human, financial and physical resources through activities of planning, coordination, and control (Cronje, Du Toit, Motlatla & Marais, 2004). 
In all cases, however, the focus of this study is to examine specifically the manner in which stakeholders’ relationships are build and strategic decisions are made and implemented, respectively at a governance and senior management level, because these two levels are so closely intertwined in those higher education institutions focused on for purposes of this study.  As a result, managerial duties such as planning, coordination, and control as these apply to higher education institutions do not form part of this study.  Given the interwoven nature of governance and management in these institutions, though, and the focus on interpersonal relationships, it is of significant importance for this study that governance and management are seen as interpersonal and relational activities by experts in this field.  As an example, Ehrich (2005) espouses the view that management, and governance, is not a neat set of rational activities. Accordingly, she states that  these are complex and unpredictable, even “messy”, due to the focus on interpersonal relationships and the human dimension thereof (Ehrich, 2005:8).
Approaching governance from a human and relational point of view, rather than from a rational and quantifiable point of view, requires an appropriate research approach and research method. Considering governance from a human-relational point of view would require a qualitative research approach. Such an approach would enable the research to describe and analyse human experiences which are not necessarily expressible in quantities, but in descriptions. 
Such a descriptive method of human experience was developed during the 19th and 20th century, aiming to accurately describe individuals experience of things, processes, and objects. This development occurred partly in response to the exclusive use of positivistic research methods (Ehrich 2005:7). These new existential research methods aimed at accurately describing individuals’ experience of things, processes and objects. The experiences were referred to as “phenomenon”. The study of phenomenon, which became known as phenomenology, developed into a research method used to discover knowledge and develop theories from such description. 
Phenomenology, therefore, is used when looking at meaning from human experience, and it may also be used to explore human experiences in management, and for these purposes in governance in particular. Specifically, it may help us to describe the complexity of human experience about governance in order to understand the phenomenon of governance itself. In this regard Ehrich (2005:8) in her analysis of phenomenological studies in management sciences states: 
…phenomenology turns away from science and scientific knowledge and returns to the things themselves. The effects of investigating particular human experiences outside the confines of pre-existing theories and well establish constructs can yield ‘startling new insights into the uniquely complex processes of … managing and leading’ (Van der Mescht, 2004, p.1). 

As researcher, my motivation for this study originates from my practical experience over almost two decades within a Christian higher education institution. My key experiences contributing to this study were at board of director level, as well as head of the institution. These positions provided me with first-hand experience of the influence board and governance structures and associated processes, or the lack thereof, may have on key performance areas such as the choice and direction of curriculum development, appointment of staff, and stakeholder relationships. The author became aware of the potential impact of incomplete and unclear founding documents and weak administration of governance processes in the absence of best practice guidance. The author also came to the conclusion that benefits could be gained by guidance on how to diversify the composition of the board in order to ensure that more voices are heard and that more ideas are expressed and evaluated, and consequently realised the necessity to regulate outside stakeholder interest and influences through governance guidance. During this time, the author visited seven international Christian higher education institutions as part of field observations, enquiring how these institutions operate within their unique contexts. These visits made the author aware of the different governance structures of Christian higher education institutions across the world, and the impact which governance has on operations and achieving institutional goals. South African Christian higher education is part of the worldwide phenomenon of Christian higher education, all of which requires governance within this unique contextual setting.
My own awareness of governance shortcomings, or gaps against an ideal model of governance, is reinforced by Murdoch’s (2018) analysis of a general lack of understanding of governance features and Diedericks and Diedericks (2019) analysis of a lack of oversight. As a result, the purpose of this study is to develop guidelines for institutional governance of Christian higher education institutions in South Africa. This is to be done by first developing and then comparing a conceptual model of governance for private Christian higher education institutions with the actual experience of those persons responsible for governance in Christian higher education institutions in South Africa. The conceptual model is to be developed from and based on the needs and requirements unique to private higher education institutions, the nature of Christian higher education and the theoretical perspective provided through ethical stakeholder theory. The experiences of those involved in governance is described through a qualitative research approach. 
A qualitative interpretative inquiry is proposed in the form of a phenomenological study. Data is collected through in-depth interviews with governance role players and through a structured methodology distilled into a description of their experiences. The data and descriptions of experiences resulting from the data collection and descriptive process are validated by analysis of institutional documents and essays, and through a focus group interview. Together, this information is used to provide an in-depth description of the experiences of those in governance about the phenomenon of governance in private Christian higher education institutions. 
Finally, the conceptual model is to be compared to the description of the experiences of governance role players. This comparison is to be analysed, and the results thereof are consequently to be presented as guidelines for Christian higher education institutions. 
Little research has been done regarding private higher education in South Africa, and even less research exists on the governance of private higher education (Murdoch, 2018:22). This study will contribute to understanding this distinct but important sector of higher education in South Africa and globally, and specifically the governance of institutions in this sector.

3.	RESEARCH FOCUS
3.1	RESEARCH PROBLEM AND PROBLEM STATEMENT
Higher education institutions are complex organisations. It has been indicated that higher education institutions are unique amongst all other types of organisations in society. As a complex, unique type of organisation facing wide ranging challenges, they require governance arrangements which are appropriate and aligned to their circumstances (Fourie, 2009:351; Department of Higher Education and Training, 2017:11). 
The uniqueness of higher education institutions relates to, amongst others, their increasing size, while highly regulated in performing a public interest activity, while striving for autonomy. Due to these factors and the public interest dimension, governance challenges oftentimes play out in the media.
Recent events illustrate the challenges governance role players face. After a ministerial task team was appointed at Unisa to investigate various “concerns” (Department of Higher Education and Training, 2020:1), the legal services director was suspended, who in turn requested the minister of higher education to dissolve the university’s council (Fengu, 2021). At Fort Hare, following an investigation after allegations of corruption and misconduct, the deputy vice-chancellor for institutional support was placed on precautionary suspension, with President Cyril Ramaphosa subsequently authorising a Special Investigating Unit (SIU) investigation into contracts and awarding of certain degrees at this institution (Basson & Dayimani, 2022).
In a recent report regarding governance at public higher education institutions the (DHET), provides a brief overview of the seriousness of governance challenges (Department of Higher Education and Training, 2017:9):
Since the Higher Education Act was promulgated for the first time in 1997, no less than 14 independent assessor investigations were conducted into the governance and administration of the affected universities. Very disconcerting is the fact that in the case of 4 universities, such investigations were conducted more than once. In 11 cases these investigations resulted in their councils being dissolved and the institutions being placed under administration in terms of the Higher Education Act.

The 2019 meeting report of parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Higher Education, Science and Innovation refers to governance 60 times, discusses governance challenges at length, and anecdotally mentions that 20% of institutions “were not doing well” in terms of governance (National Assembly, 2019).  
Furthermore, private higher education institutions, as a subset of higher education in South Africa, are exposed to additional challenges. They do not receive any funding from government, while they are still required to comply with the same requirements as large publicly funded higher education institutions. This places additional strain and responsibility on the shoulders of those in charge of governance at private higher education institutions. In these circumstances it would be expected that governance role players exhibit appropriate and sufficient understanding of what is expected and required to effectively govern their institutions. In contrast, Murdoch (2018:104) finds amongst role players in governance in private higher education a general lack of understanding of governance, a lack of ability to engage on the phenomenon of governance, and no common terminology of governance, coupled with a lack of what is required or expected. These governance shortcomings threaten the educational outcomes (Murdoch, 2018:139) and even the existence of private higher education institutions. This can be seen in the list of private higher education institutions which have been deregistered by the Department of Higher Education and Training (Department of Higher Education and Training, 2021b:135). Although the reason offered for deregistration would not directly indicate governance failure, it should be understood that events leading to deregistration should have been on the agenda of those charged with governance. Other examples of potential governance failure include the unfortunate step by a Christian higher education institution to sell a campus due to financial constraints (St Augustine, 2022), and a seminary being deregistered for not providing a tax clearance certificate as part of their annual report to the DHET (Department of Higher Education and Training, 2022). Furthermore, apart from being private organisations, Christian higher education institutions in South Africa operate as non-profit organisations. Non-profit organisations in South Africa have been criticised for weak operational sustainability (Maboya & McKay, 2019:1) and they make up the majority of organisations losing their registration with the DHET (Diedericks & Diedericks, 2019). 
Christian higher education institutions constitute a small percentage of all higher education worldwide and an even smaller number in South Africa, while simultaneously being exposed to local and global changing market forces and trends in higher education.  Given the unique role they fulfil in society, the imperative arises to assess, refine, improve and build the capacity to govern these organisations for the public good. 
As a general measure to ensure good governance, industries and entities form codes of governance. In South Africa the DHET published a document titled “Guidelines for good governance practice and governance indicators for councils of South African public higher education institutions” (Department of Higher Education and Training, 2017). In addition, South Africa and indeed the rest of the world is in the fortunate position to have access to the King IV Report on Corporate Governance for South Africa (Institute of Directors of South Africa, 2016) and its code of good governance. However, the DHET has expressed the opinion that the King IV Code on its own is not appropriate for governance of higher education institutions (Department of Higher Education and Training, 2017:4). The DHET Code was published for public institutions and consequently there remains very little guidance for private higher education institutions.
Given the above reasoning, the problem statement of this study is as follows: Christian higher education institutions demonstrate a lack of understanding of governance and a lack of engagement with the phenomenon of governance, and this leads to underperformance and threatens their sustainable existence in South Africa, yet with little guidance to govern under these circumstances.
The purpose of this research is to develop a comprehensive understanding and assessment of the current governance practices of Christian higher education institutions in South Africa and to develop guidelines for institutional governance in Christian higher education institutions. 
3.2	RESEARCH QUESTIONS
Based on the literature review, the theoretical and philosophical perspectives and the problem statement, the following research questions are proposed for this study:
1. What are the nature and distinguishing features of Christian higher education institutions in comparison to the norm?
2. What are the general nature and distinguishing features of institutional governance in Christian higher education institutions?
3. How are Christian higher education institutions currently governed? 
4. Why are they governed in that way?
5. What are the possible set of governance practices and success indicators for governance models or approaches employed in Christian higher education in South Africa?
6. Given such practices and indicators, what guidelines for institutional governance for Christian higher education institutions in South Africa should be developed to help increase the rate of success for these institutions?
3.3	RESEARCH AIM
The purpose of this study is to develop guidelines for institutional governance of Christian higher education institutions in South Africa. A conceptual model of governance for private Christian higher education institutions is developed and compared to the experience of participants in governance. The conceptual model is adapted from Murdoch’s (2018) conceptual model for governance in private higher education in South Africa. Her model integrates the most important aspects of higher education governance within the specific context of private higher education in South Africa. The adapted model is based on the needs and requirements unique to private higher education institutions, the nature of Christian higher education and the theoretical perspectives provided through the ethical stakeholder theory.

4.	LITERATURE REVIEW
The literature review provides an overview of those aspects which are of main importance to this study. These aspects align to the study’s title and include higher education, Christian higher education, and governance. 
The literature review is structured as follows: The context of the topic is higher education as an organisation, and in an effort to effectively position the topic, the first section discusses the nature of a university as an organisation. The second section reviews the concept of governance, discussing governance in general as well as governance in higher education. The third section gives an overview of the current landscape of higher education in South Africa. This is followed in the fourth section by a brief discussion of the history of the university as an institution. The fifth section discusses Christian higher education as a particular kind of higher education. This is done in two parts, of which the first part relates to the worldviews generally informing Christian higher education, and the second part considers the nature of Christian higher education organisations as an organisation. Section six discusses Christian higher education in South Africa in three parts. Part one considers the history and changes at Potchefstroom University for Christian higher education, which became the North-West University, as representative of a typical public Christian higher education institution in South Africa. The second part considers the calls that have been made for the establishment of new Christian higher education institutions in South Africa. The third part looks into literature about governance and organisational matters in Christian higher education in South Africa. The seventh and last section of the literature review discusses the proposed theoretical and conceptual framework to be considered when developing guidelines for governance in Christian higher education institutions in South Africa.
4.1	NATURE OF UNIVERSITY AS AN ORGANISATION
This section considers the wide-ranging attributes considered to form part of the nature of the university as an organisation. It is important to identify and distinguish the different characteristics of what a university could potentially be viewed as. The manner in which an entity is governed will be impacted by the nature of the entity. The attributes include, as set out below, that the university exhibits many characteristics and aims, including being a pluralistic, decentralised organisation, an institute, a community, creating knowledge and forming students, amongst others. Moreover, universities have existed for centuries and have been defined in different ways and have evolved over time, shedding some characteristics while developing new ones. Some characteristics and aims have remained consistent to a certain degree, for example the pursuit of knowledge as well as a transnational character. In other aspects much has changed – from being a community of scholars working from unified principles under ecclesiastical authority to being primarily under governmental authority fulfilling multiple purposes at present.  
In referring to the original aims of the university, Carpenter (2014:10) describes these, respectively, as a craft, working in personal ways towards the formation of students and faculty in a process of discovery, the creation of knowledge, and the search for truth and that which is worthy. It is an organisation which “inherits and conserves the aggregate wisdom and cultural goods of humanity”, while passing on practical values, community responsibility and developing an ethic of service. These aims, he argues, have now become narrower as the university as organisation is expected to assist in growing economies, supply a skilled workforce, focus on technical capabilities and are subject to industrialisation and cost-cutting measures where the end result expected is a product rather than serving as a formative influence upon humanity. 
Considering the university in the era after the Second World War, Lockwood (2011:125) describes the university as being multi-formed and fragmented. “Multi-formed” refers to it being an organisation formed as a rational-legal entity, also being an institution promoting scholarship and research and being a community providing social relationships, infrastructure, and cohesion. The nature of its activities is fragmented into teaching, learning, and research, each requiring unique skills and autonomy while providing output which is difficult to measure and assess by the outside world. He indicates that the core tradition of the university is maintaining autonomy and academic freedom Lockwood (2011:127). 
Fourie (2009:351) emphasises that due to the fundamental differences between higher education and other types of organisations, higher education needs governance structures and processes which are “very specific to and typical of universities”. Distinguishing characteristics of higher education institutions include goal ambiguity, pluralistic form, consisting of decentralised units with weak linkages and autonomy of academics as professionals.  The university can therefore be viewed as a legal entity for regulatory purposes, while being a scholarly institute and a community of administrators, academics and students. It is concerned with the pursuit of knowledge while maintaining a tradition of autonomy and academic freedom for which governance is required  
Carpenter (2014:13), though, points to an important recent development in higher education, highlighting that 30% of higher education worldwide is now conducted through independently developed higher education institutions. A characteristic of these independent institutions is that their governance structures are more authoritarian than state and church-related institutions or in the form of family enterprises and provide less space for shared governance.  This calls for a closer look at governance. 
4.2	GOVERNANCE
This section discusses the phenomenon of governance. Broadly speaking governance is the structure and process directing decisions and actions of an entity, and the way in which directors discharge their responsibilities. Governance will vary depending on the different forms and size of entities. Governance requirements may be prescribed in a combination of legislation, guidelines and in the founding documents of entities. A general discussion on governance is subsequently provided, followed by a discussion on governance in higher education.
4.2.1	GOVERNANCE IN GENERAL
King (2006:1,18) describes governance as “the manner of directing and controlling the actions and affairs of an entity” as well as “a process to help directors discharge and be seen to discharging their responsibilities created by their duties” while pointing out that governance is dynamic and impacted by events. He highlights the distinction that governance is about process while enterprise is about “business judgement calls” for receiving reward considering the risk taken. This connects the concepts of risk and reward to governance. Due to human frailty and those in governance not being prescient, some business calls may not be accurate or successful. Decisions should not, however, be taken in circumstances where inappropriate governance processes are adopted. Therefore, good governance is not negotiable for organisations (King, 2006:19). 
King (2006:25), furthermore, promotes an inclusive and mutually beneficial approach to governance, including the identification of stakeholders and the interest of stakeholders when developing strategic business plans.  King (2006:10,19) also notes that the context in which governance takes place is complex, that risks need to be taken in making business decisions, and that governance participants are ultimately responsible for the success of their organisations. They should discharge their responsibilities and be able to prove this through working with sound principles and guidelines. Governance is not a tick box exercise and is evidenced by a global drive to develop codes and guidelines for governance. The development of codes and guidelines for governance is also evidenced globally and locally, with publications such as the King Code of Corporate Governance (Institute of Directors of South Africa, 2016) and the UK Corporate Governance Code (Financial Reporting Council, 2018).
The development of codes and guidelines is not limited to the corporate environment. In an attempt to improve governance in South African public higher education, the DHET issued its own set of guidelines for “good governance practice” in public higher education institutions (Department of Higher Education and Training, 2017).
It has been the convention in many codes of governance to refer to governance using the adjective good, creating the expression “good governance”. In considering the use or not of such a descriptor, other options may also be applicable, for example, effective and efficient governance, reflective governance, proactive governance or responsible governance. The choice of the term “good” proves to be an effective catch-all phrase referencing many purposes. However, for purposes of this study, and considering the discussions about worldviews on higher education and the influence of various ideologies on higher education such as capitalism, I propose not to use any descriptor. In this sense governance is referred to in its essence, being definitive as a term on its own. The contention with a descriptor in the current study becomes the association of the descriptor with an ideology, for example the descriptor “good” may hint of a corporate managerial type of governance while not capturing other important aspects such as promotion of a Christ-centred identity.
The focus now must turn to governance in higher education specifically. 
4.2.2	GOVERNANCE IN HIGHER EDUCATION
Governance structures and processes are usually set out in legislation and regulations, as well as in organisational documents such as founding documents and policies and procedures. These regulatory and governing documents are the formal expression of certain approaches or views regarding governance. This section considers the different approaches towards governance in higher education.
Approaches to governance are based on a particular view of the university as organisation (Lockwood, 2011:126). Accordingly, approaches vary widely, ranging from proposing a cultural focus, to a synthetic collaborative approach. The different approaches to governance in higher education possibly also reflect the varied views of the university as a paradox, with tension between participants in a changing environment.   
Tierney (2009) analyses different governance concepts in the diverse and established higher education market of the United States of America (USA). The nature of governance in higher education organisations inherently causes tension between participants. Simultaneously changes in the higher education environment add pressure to governance structures and processes. Changes include increased competition, challenges in determining quality and changes in the market requiring vocation-focused programmes. Protecting and maintaining the premise of higher education (the production and dissemination of knowledge in an environment of academic freedom and institutional autonomy) within a changing environment ultimately require effective governance. This requires higher education institutions to seriously consider their approach to governance, which Tierney (2009:209) argues should be culturally focused and based on building trust. Tierney (2009:210) provides a cultural framework as an approach to governance. When contemplating approaches to governance, he proposes a framework using cultural perspectives in which the environment is continually interpreted to internal and external stakeholders through ideas labelled as trust, common language, walk the talk and core identities.   
Collis (2009) describes a paradox in higher education where the organisation’s core activities shrink in relation to the expansion of activities on the periphery. This paradox causes weaknesses in governance which are exacerbated by higher education, in general, being less effective in governance and management than private enterprise. Suggestions to improve governance include: minimizing the agency problem, improving board effectiveness, and addressing strategy (Collis 2009:63-68).  
Keller (2009) describes a synthetic collaborative governance model which balances academic and administrative freedom, pluralism in governance, authority exercised dependent on level of authority, use of “Kleenex” or task force structures and a focus on duty and responsibility. 
Lockwood (2011) analyses how European universities maintain and adapt governance in the presence of external and internal pressures. Changes in the nature of universities and the external and internal pressures make management more complex and difficult to understand. Approaches to governance depend on how each role player views the university. Forces of change impacting on governance include proliferation of knowledge, increased competition, advances in technology, socio-political movements, increased legislation and political and regulatory know-how.
4.2.3	GOVERNANCE IN HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH AFRICA 
Limited formal research exists regarding institutional governance in private higher education in South Africa. Fourie (2009) explores the role of governance in South African higher education in general. She discusses three conventional models of governance in higher education referred to as collegial, professional bureaucratic and political. Her analysis, although general, is not aimed at private institutions in the first place. Collegial models favour consensus in decision-making working towards common goals to be achieved. In professional bureaucratic models, role players are professionals in their fields acting within a bureaucratic environment, leading to divergence due to contesting allegiance to the profession and its values versus the goals of the institution and its values. In the political model, policy forming processes lead the organisation to set goals and the process takes the form of negotiation, coalitions and the formation of compromises. These traditional models are challenged by issues of funding, management and competition. She observes that a hybrid model is developing with a corporate nature and power is moving from academics to administrators. Examples of two new models are provided, a managed managerialism model (Coughlan, 2006) and trustee model. She concludes by providing four guiding principles for institutional governance; recognition of competing interests, shared vision, sense of trust and communication.
Murdoch (2018) reports on the state of governance in for-profit private higher education in South Africa and finds a gap compared to the ideal state of governance. She reports about the exclusion of academics from governance processes and structures and finds limited academic governance practices and processes among the institutions studied.  This finding highlights important differences from public institutions, where in public institutions the university senate and its members are typically represented on the university council, so, at least de jure all academics when following a public university model should be represented in the typical university governance structures. This, she finds, is not the case in for-profit private higher education institutions.
According to Murdoch (2018) for-profit private higher education governance structures in South Africa are predominantly experienced as corporate in nature if not in functioning, following a business-like institutional design, focussing on commercial success, and much shaped as so-called shared or collegial governance models. This imbalance is evident in the lack of coherence in academic processes, with inconclusive links between policy development, policy approvals and their place in governance (Murdoch, 2018:117). Ineffective governance has a potential impact on credibility and quality of educational outcomes. There is a lack of integration, reporting takes place mostly at board level and is driven by operational and financial measures, and governance structures are not clearly present but appear to be of a more ad hoc nature. Governance structures, furthermore, are not linked to the external environment and are mainly internally focused and therefore do not support a response to contextual challenges these institutions may experience  
Murdoch (2018:131-133) further reports a general lack of understanding of governance among participants in her research, a lack of ability to engage on the phenomenon of governance, and no common terminology of governance, coupled with a lack of what is required or expected of the governance function and those responsible for this function. Higher education institutions are collegial in nature and require an integrated approach with strong academic involvement. However, academics seem to not be equipped to discuss broader institutional issues (Murdoch, 2018:38).
4.3	HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH AFRICA
Public universities are established and governed in accordance with, and subject to, the Higher Education Act (101/1997). After various governance challenges which required ministerial intervention, the DHET, with the support of national government, initiated a broad consultative process to establish good governance guidelines and governance indicators for governance in public higher education institutions. The outcome of the project was a guidance document with governance indicators, titled Guidelines for Good Governance Practice and Governance Indicators for Councils of South African Public Higher Education Institutions (Department of Higher Education and Training, 2017). This document summarises the legal and regulatory framework for public higher education institutions in South Africa as follows (Department of Higher Education and Training, 2017:9):
The current system of governance for the South African public higher education institutions is constituted in the Higher Education Act No 101 of 1997. In terms of the Higher Education Act, the main institutional governance structures are council; the senate; the institutional forum and the Student Representative Council (SRC). The council is the highest decision-making body and is responsible for ensuring good governance of the institution subject to the Higher Education Act and relevant institutional statutes. The senate is accountable to the council with regard to academic and research functions of an institution. The institutional forum advises the council on issues affecting the institution as stipulated in the Act. The SRC has a jurisdiction, subject to Council, over certain student matters. Senates and SRCs also exercise their primary governance role through their membership of university councils as provided for by the Higher Education Act. 

The governance relationship between the councils and senates; between councils and SRCs; and between councils and institutional forums is set out in the Higher Education Act, Act 101 of 1997, amended. The relevant provisions in the Act set out in which cases council can only act after having consulted these three structures and in which cases such consultation takes the form of non-binding ‘after consultation’ or binding ‘in consultation’. It is required that councils must follow these prescriptions meticulously as part of good governance practices in their institutions.

There are at present 25 public universities in South Africa (Department of Higher Education and Training 2021a). Current legislation also allows for private higher education institutions. According to the latest register of private higher education institutions, there are 93 registered and 36 provisionally registered institutions (Department of Higher Education and Training 2021b). 
In contrast to public higher education institutions, private higher education institutions are established according to corporate legislation, primarily for-profit or not-for-profit companies. They are required to register with the Registrar for Private Higher Education Institutions. They are registered and regulated through the applicable provisions of the Higher Education Act (101/1997) and Regulations for the Registration of Private Higher Education Institutions (Department of Higher Education and Training, 2016:6). Accordingly, private higher education institutions need to govern themselves in terms of good governance practice, which includes compliance with the regulations of the relevant regulatory authorities as set out above.
No specific guidance exists for the governance of non-profit higher education institutions except the general guidelines provided in the King Code of Governance (Institute of Directors of South Africa, 2016), which mainly addresses corporate governance aspects for commercial enterprises.  This, of course, is a major weakness in the governance framework for private higher education institutions in South Africa, especially given that Christian higher education institutions predominantly comprise non-profit organisations.  
4.4	A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY
A brief history of the university is set out in this section. Much has been written regarding the history of the university as organisation. The importance of a historical overview for the current study, however, is to provide an overview of trends and influences which potentially impact a conceptual model of governance arrangements of today’s universities. It is also important to understand where private higher education is placed in the historical chronology of the university. 
Glanzer, Alleman, and Ream’s (2017) historical overview of the university revolves around the changes in the purpose of the university over time. They locate the purpose as being expressed in the identity, story, and mission of a university. They argue for restoring theology as the unifying purpose within a university. They trace the evolution of the purpose of the university starting from theology as the prominent purpose during medieval times. This purpose shifted to moral and natural law after the Reformation. During the late 18th century and into the 19th century it took on a national character based on scientific naturalism, and during the 20th century it assumed democratic liberal freedom as purpose. These shifts eventually led to the fragmentation of a unifying purpose of the university.
Their analysis commences with the medieval period, when the church played a vital role and was closely connected with the university, including protecting its academic freedom. Philosophy was defined as intelligent friendship with God to understand and discover God’s ideas through natural and special revelation, and the purpose of education was defined as restoration of the image of God in man. The church and university shared, amongst others, a transnational character. A split emerged between how faith (theology) and reason (philosophy) were viewed distinctively in the university. A significant shift occurred during the Reformation, which saw the emergence of the denominational church, and consequently, the denominational university with differing hierarchical structures. The number of universities in Europe doubled by 1789, while confessional differences damaged the view that theology was the unifying purpose in the university. Purpose was now sought in moral agreement and the law of nature rather than theology. At the same time, there was a growing interest in the benefits the university could have for nations, and during the 18th and 19th century there was increased interest by European states in university life. These transformative forces would result in the purpose of the university gravitating from theology to reason and nature. The challenge was that nature is not explicit in political and moral matters. However, this challenge was in most part not solved through advances in epistemology, but through political action and political thought. The disbanding of the Jesuit order and the French revolution had a severe impact on universities in France leading to an essential change in the institutions’ purpose, structure and curriculum, now mainly aimed at serving the state. In Germany, Kant organised knowledge in terms of political authority and the government's interest in areas of knowledge. With the rise of German idealism and radical nationalism the purpose of the university turned to serving the state by focusing on the use of science. The University of Berlin, founded in 1810, was the first European university to sever ties with confessionally defined Christianity. The new university model employed at the University of Berlin would eventually lead to significant advances in science and research to become a model for many higher education institutions worldwide. 
From these events Glanzer et al. (2017) identify trends of nationalisation within university life which impacted governance. These were amongst others:
•	Removal of legal privilege provided by the ecclesiastical authorities, and in its place, the state became the grantor of legal legitimacy;
•	The state took control of funding and governance of universities;
•	Structures in higher education became nationally focused with, amongst others, the establishment of national science academies;
•	Language of teaching and learning and research changed from Latin to the vernacular of the state;
•	Theology was abolished, or lost its leadership position, with the state appointing academics within theology departments and the faculty of law becoming the leading academic discipline due to its importance to the state.
There were some attempts to recover lost ground for theology, notably through John Henry Newman (1996) who defended the place of theology in a series of lectures titled The Idea of a University in 1852. He argued that the omission of one of the sciences from the whole of knowledge prejudices knowledge. However, this could not stem the tide of scientific enquiry and nationalism. Especially in North America the rapidly growing university system was accompanied by liberal democracy as this political philosophy increasingly gained ground as the preeminent purpose of universities.
Glanzer et al. (2017) discuss the North American universities during their first centuries of existence, showing them to be mainly confessional, maintaining a private focus, free from government regulation and following a liberal arts curriculum.  As late as 1861, 162 of 182 higher education institutions were still church-related. This institutional freedom led to plurality, which simultaneously created the potential for conflict. Academic and national leaders, specifically after independence, preferred to approach knowledge from an anti-sectarian view to avoid conflict and promote professionalisation and civic identity. This narrative of freedom and liberal democracy through scientific naturalism become the soul of the university, not aligned to confessionally defined Christianity or nature. The liberal democratic ideal, together with open scientific enquiry finally fragmented the idea of any one central unifying purpose. With multiple purposes now emerging, specifically after World War II, Glanzer et al. (2017:107) argue that the university now attracted more resources and research than any previous era in the university’s history.
When considering more recent trends in higher education, significant growth of private higher education is observed (Glanzer & Carpenter, 2014:290). Where higher education was historically related to church, emperor, and state, for the first time in history a significant number of private institutions have emerged.
In summary, if a broad view is taken of the history of the purpose of the university, three eras can be recognised. During the first era the university was governed and protected by ecclesiastical authority and later also through rulers and emperors, and the university had a transnational character. The purpose of the university was aimed at serving these authorities. The second era is recognised by a national and scientific character and purpose, serving the interest of nations. The third era is characterised by a democratic and global nature, serving democratic well-being. At the end of the last era the emergence of private higher education is observed. The implications for those in governance of universities are that these macro trends occurring on a global scale will impact the prevailing purpose, form, structure and ways of being a university. Specifically, current era role-players in governance of higher education institutions, serving particular purposes and markets, for example Christian higher education institutions, may have an ever-increasing duty to ensure they govern in such a manner that their institutions remain strong and viable. The following influences and trends could potentially be included in a conceptual model for private Christian higher education:
•	Purpose driver – clearly define own purpose, understand its place in history and the current higher education environment, be open to discourse, and own the purpose.
•	External social participant – increased awareness of the external, political and macro environment, forming networks, having an outward focus instead of inwardly focused.
•	Knowledge contributor – increased awareness of and participation in current epistelogical discourses, while maintaining own unique position.
•	Resource builder – increased attention to acquiring and allocating monetary and physical resources.
This section provided a brief history of the university, suggesting distinguishing features which may contribute to a conceptual model of governance in Christian higher education. The purpose of such a historical overview is to understand the place of Christian higher education in history and use such understanding to govern well. To govern well, and closely related to the history of the university, is an understanding of worldviews and practices which are unique to Christian higher education institutions. The next section will attempt to shed some light on the contribution which a worldview can make to a conceptual model of governance in Christian higher education.
4.5	THE NATURE OF CHRISTIAN HIGHER EDUCATION
In an attempt to define and distinguish what characteristics make Christian higher education a distinct phenomenon within higher education, this section sets out a worldview of Christian scholarship and shows how that leads to the unique nature of Christian higher education institutions as a particular category of organisations.
Christian higher education refers to institutions where the vision and mission of the entity is specific to a Christian identity and purpose and where such a vision and mission cascade into topics and themes within the institution, including the curriculum, teaching and learning, governance, student life, faculty and staff and campus life (Diedericks & Diedericks, 2019:2). 
Christian institutions and Christian society are based on the idea of community, and societal relationships play an important role in the structure of Christian institutions. These institutions are not an extension of the government or of the church, but they represent an own unique societal phenomenon.
In a series of articles Van der Walt (2014a; 2014b; 2014c; 2015) sets out broad outlines of a worldview for Christian higher education. The unique nature of a Christian higher education institution is informed by such a worldview. This is important for the current study since a conceptual model of governance will also be informed thereby. Such a worldview informs the conceptual model by making clear what is being promoted as an organisation through its purpose, vision and mission. Furthermore, it clarifies what needs to be protected to remain true to its purpose, for example faith integrated scholarship and pluralism. It also informs academic governance by guiding how the purpose filters through and is embedded in educational outcomes. 
Salient matters included in such a worldview, highlighted by the series of articles, include:
•	Epistemologically, reason is not regarded as neutral and knowledge is not solely rational-analytical.
•	Faith is integrated into scholarship.
•	Structural pluralism provides for different spheres of relationship, each with its own responsibility, tasks and authority, for example, the university as sphere.
•	Confessional pluralism provides that each sphere is governed or directed according to its own religious and worldview conviction, and be equally free to express their convictions in public.
•	The responsibility to employ convictions in the outside world without conforming to the external environment, through the correct interpretation of pluralism in society, which means that sovereignty of spheres should be respected, tolerance is required and influence among organisations are accorded.
•	Three basic views on the task of Christian higher education exist, namely moulding of the whole of life, scholarly-theoretical education, and higher education to serve society at large.
•	An articulated approach to culture should be defined, including views on ideologies and how ideologies are analysed and judiciously embedded and transmitted.
•	Rejection of dualistic worldview which divide society into public and private and consequently lead to “churchism” of Christian higher education.
These worldview matters should be considered in a conceptual model of governance in higher education. The following worldview assertions derived from the list above could potentially be included in a conceptual model for private Christian higher education:
•	Faith integrated scholarship – define the organsation’s unique scholarly model.
•	Practical pluralism – define own structural and confessional identity and use this with tolerance and influence in society, including an articulated approach to culture, and the rejection of dualistic worldviews.
•	Defined educational task - the organisation should define this in its specific context, for example how moulding of the whole of life, scholarly-theoretical education, and higher education to serve society at large will be made practical in the organsation’s specifc time and place.
BENNE HERE
This section provided a brief overview of worldviews within the Christian university, suggesting items which may contribute to a conceptual model of governance in Christian higher education. The purpose of such an overview is to understand the place of worldviews in Christian higher education and use such understanding to govern well. A broad reconaissance of the history and worldviews of Christian higher education have been provided. In the next section the focus shifts to Christian higher education in South Africa.
4.6	CHRISTIAN HIGHER EDUCATION IN SOUTH AFRICA
Following on from the discussion about the nature of Christian higher education in general, the next section looks at Christian higher education in South Africa. In general, Christian higher education institutions are a societal phenomenon flowing from a calling within a Christian community to establish higher education institutions with a Christian identity, reflected in the vision and mission of the institution and filtering down into the structures and operations of such institution. 
This study classifies the South African literature on Christian higher education into four groups of topics. Firstly, those that concern the history and changes at Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education (PUCHE) and its later manifestation as North-West University. Secondly, articles of which the aim is to make a call to action for more Christian higher education institutions to be established in South Africa. Thirdly, those that touch on organisational matters of Christian higher education institutions. Limited research is available on Christian higher education as an organisation in South Africa since 1994.
4.6.1	CONSIDERING THE HISTORY AND CHANGES AT POTCHEFSTROOM UNIVERSITY FOR CHRISTIAN HIGHER EDUCATION  
PUCHE has been the main historical representation of a public Christian higher education institution in South Africa, and therefore reflection on aspects of its history and its secularisation is of importance for this study. Botha (2000) investigates the relationship between the tasks of a university and the concept of reconciliation. The departure point is an understanding of the nature of a university and investigating the self-identity and vision of the institution. She questions why the ideal of Christian scholarship changed and diluted over time, and in PUCHE’s case, she hypothesises that this was due to the barrier of the dualistic “Christian national” ideology. 
She points out that a worldview or philosophy is the mediating notion between Scripture and knowledge of the world or Scripture and scholarship. In the PUCHE’s case, the way this worldview or philosophy was understood did not effectively reform scholarship and “derailed the quest for a Christian academic witness that could contribute to actual societal and political reconciliation” (Botha, 2000:3).  In its academic self-identity she is of the opinion PUCHE was “world embracing and world affirmative” more than dualistic and pietistic (Botha, 2000:3). She observes a shift in identity “related to philosophical and ideological shifts in the surrounding culture” and the understanding of scholarship (Botha, 2000:4).
According to Reformed tradition, no aspect of existence is religiously neutral, which would include the interaction between politics and a university. However, she questions the manner in which such tradition was applied or ignored. 
Perhaps the most intriguing question concerning the role of Potchefstroom University is the question why this institution which so courageously positioned itself in the struggle against neutrality in scholarship and education and for the propagation of the Lordship of Jesus Christ in all areas of life did not in a similar fashion speak out prophetically and critically against the obvious injustice of the South African apartheid system (Botha, 2000:10).

Extending her line of questioning, she refers to Professor H.J. Stoker as main philosophical voice, who posited that all knowledge is religiously underpinned. He argued separate development was justified. She views this as an example of how PUCHE’s Christian character was influenced by the “dominant political-ideological views of the surrounding culture” (Botha, 2000:11). She points out that Stoker wrote much about Christian scholarship but little about the university and its role in broader society.  Interestingly, Stoker made use of the concept of university freedom to demonstrate that the university should be free to serve its own racial group (Botha, 2000:12).
Van der Walt (2014b) references the Vrije Universiteit and the University of Fort Hare as different examples of cultural influences leading to changes at Christian higher education institutions. In his analyses the Vrije Universiteit which was secularised from inside and not necessarily outside, and the University of Fort Hare, which was established by Scottish Reformed missionaries, were politicized “with little consideration for its original Christian character”.
A similar discussion of secularisation through politicisation of PUCHE is provided by Van der Walt (2014b). His overview covers three periods. He observes that during the years 1974 to 1977 the Christian-National ideal was uncritically accepted, largely to protect the institution’s subsidy income. The idea of Christian-National education inherited from Netherlands, active from 1869 was still “safe”. Van der Walt (2014b:34) highlights the danger of the National influencing the Christian because Christian-National is a paradoxical relationship. He points to a dualism that ensues on the back of this paradox, which ultimately does not allow the comprehensive development of a Christian framework of biblical revelation of creation, fall, redemption, and consummation. Another important factor highlighted by Van der Walt (2014b:34) was the excessive growth of PUCHE which made it difficult to maintain a community of scholars with a specific Christian identity.
The second period of his Van der Walt’s review covers the years 1978-1987 during which he attempts to show that the meaning of Christian National became less clear (2014b:35).  The ideology of Apartheid generally became less accepted while some believed it was still integrated with Christianity. To address this tension, projects were launched where the university’s Christian character was evaluated anew, a credo developed, and publications produced on what a Christian university should be. However, even though the formal statutes contained the Christian historical character, none of the newly evaluated projects were mentioned or implemented.
During the last period (1987-2000) covered in his analysis, Van der Walt suggests that a vacuum developed (2014b:36). New ideas through internationalisation brought a mix of influences and ideologies which were shaping Western culture and the academic world.  Worldwide and also in Africa this trend was not matched by new ideas from Protestant and Reformed higher education. The paradoxical relationship of Christian National as a particular education ideology now became untenable. The Christian basis now contended with a new secular constitution, while the National identity had to contend with a new constitutional democratic dispensation. Because of this set of circumstances, both the Christian and the National identities were becoming obscure while, according to Vander Walt (2014b:37) university management retained Afrikaner identity as far as possible.
Van der Walt (2014b) contends that structural pluralism and confessional pluralism were possible ways to save the independence and Christian character. For this, a strong vision of “integral Christian education” was required, but instead of matching this requirement other ideologies of western culture were promoted.  
PUCHE had a rich and recognised history as Christian higher education institution internationally. Considering the events surrounding its identity and the eventual loss of its Christian identity against the broader background described by Van der Walt, it is important to reflect upon the question of whether any new branches developed from the stump which was left. Were there any attempts to re-establish what was now lost?  This background, then, supports the imperative for an appropriate conceptual model of governance to promote and protect the purpose, vision and mission of a Christian higher education institution. 
4.6.2	CALLS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CHRISTIAN HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS
Carpenter (2014:18-19) sets out key reasons why Christian higher education institutions are being established. Partly on the back of the increase in demand for post-school training worldwide, partly due to increased allowance for private or independently developed higher education. The church and church related organisations have historically been involved in building institutions and developing society as part of the nature of the calling of the church in the world, summarised by the great commission to teach all the nations. Christian higher education remains a small percentage of all higher education institutions worldwide, but a distinctive part thereof. 
Carpenter (2014:16) points out that in the preceding ten years Africa accounted for more new Christian higher education institutions than the rest of the world combined, and between the period 1990 to 2010, 46 new Christian higher education institutions were established in Africa, excluding South Africa. 
In the almost 20 years since PUCHE changed its name there have been surprisingly few public calls and public backing for new Christian higher education institutions within literature. However, there has been a gradual but steady development of some older, and some more recently established private Christian higher education institutions operating expressly from a Christian worldview. Refer to Addendum A for a list of these. Concerning the literature, there have been limited calls for more Christian higher education institutions to be established in South Africa (Froneman 2012; Theron, 2013; Diedericks and Diedericks, 2019). 
Froneman (2012) calls for the establishment of a new Christian higher education institution in South Africa where a Reformed worldview will take a central place. This call follows the major transformation at PUCHE which left a gap in higher education options for those interested in faith-based education. He also believes there is a rich heritage of Christian thought in South Africa which could assist in the establishment of such an institution and presumably, also be preserved through and further developed in such an institution. He is sceptical that piecemeal attempts by individuals will not be the answer to Christian higher education in South Africa. He is of the opinion that like-minded people worldwide will support such an initiative. According to him such a new institution should not be denominational, be developed with a balanced Reformed approach and well-grounded and focused on integrating a Reformed worldview with all dimensions of an institution. 
Diedericks and Diedericks (2019) point out that growth opportunities exist in South Africa in private higher education and conclude that there is “room” for Christian higher education institutions in South Africa. In general, Diedericks and Diedericks (2019) point to Glanzer (2017:23) showing that Christian higher education normally grows where privatisation of higher education is allowed, and this has been specifically noticeable in Africa. In contrast, Christian higher education in South Africa showed little growth, and depending on how it is defined, there has been a decrease in Christian higher education in South Africa. In their analysis of the register of private higher education institutions, they show that as at October 2018 there were 131 registered private higher education institutions, of which 34 were non-profit entities of which 24 had some self-reference to Christianity. Their estimate is that at the time, between 6 000 and 7 000 students attended these institutions, which would account for less than 1% of the student population of South Africa.
4.6.3	GOVERNANCE AND ORGANISATIONAL MATTERS 
Concerning governance of new Christian higher education institutions in South Africa, very little has been researched and published.  
Diedericks (2016) provides guidelines for dealing with tolerance within the identity of a Christian higher education institution. The guidelines are aimed at those charged with governance and management of the institution and cover one of the important areas that management looks after, namely the identity of an institution.
Diedericks and Diedericks (2019) highlight specific challenges regarding governance including non-compliance to regulations, lack of funding and poor management. They point to evidence from the register that 62% of all institutions which were deregistered by the Department of Higher Education and Training were non-profit entities, making it even more substantial when it is considered that non-profit entities comprise only 20% of all entities on the register.
Diedericks and Diedericks (2021) provide guidelines on administrative and academic quality management for Christian higher education institutions. The guidelines include the statement that external quality assurance should be balanced and confirmed by internal quality.
4.7	SUMMARY
The number of Christian higher education institutions in South Africa is low compared to Africa and the rest of the world. The intention of this study is not to consider reasons for the slow progress of Christian higher education institutions in South Africa or to investigate methods for establishing new institutions. This study investigates the governance practices of current Christian higher education institutions in South Africa. 
The literature has shown that non-profit higher education in South Africa is susceptible to poor governance while simultaneously exposed to a changing market, growing competition and extensive regulatory compliance requirements. Good governance may be a means to ensure survival or to increase the effectiveness of the existing institutions.
No research has to date been done with a special focus on governance in private Christian higher education institutions in South Africa. This study proposes an ideal conceptual model based on literature and the lived experience of those in governance, culminating in guidelines for the governance of Christian higher education institutions.
